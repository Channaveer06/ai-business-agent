Today we discussed the progress of the AI Business Assistant project.
The main blocker is integrating the email agent with the real email API.

We need to finalize the email template format by Friday.
Please update the sales_data.csv file before generating next week's report.
Let's schedule a follow-up meeting on Monday at 3 PM.

Channaveer will prepare a short demo video for the capstone submission.
We also agreed to add basic logging and evaluation for the agents.

Overall, the project is on track but we must not delay the integration work.
